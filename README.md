## What I've learned

- Developed virtual keyboard using Java for logic and SWING library for interface
- Implemented real-time interaction and color feedback between keyboard and interface
- Added pangrams with random generation

## Running the Project

To get started, fork the repository and then follow one of these two steps:

### The easy way

1. Install the JDK 8 (Java Development Kit 8)
2. Configure your IDE path to point at the JDK 8 folder
3. Open the project into your IDE
4. Run ```Interface.java``` file

### The not-so-easy way

1. Go to the Linux terminal and install JavaFX typing: ```sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjfx -y```
2. Configure the JavaFX to run in your IDE (each IDE has its way to configure JavaFX)
3. Open the project into your IDE
4. Run ```Interface.java``` file

**Obs:** JavaFX default path = ```/usr/share/openjfx/lib```
